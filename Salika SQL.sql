-- ðŸ“Š Conclusion:
-- 
-- This analysis using the Sakila database successfully demonstrates core SQL concepts such as 
-- SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, views, and indexing. Key business insights include:
-- 
-- 1. Top customers identified by total payments can guide loyalty programs.
-- 2. Certain films have never been rented â€” indicating inventory inefficiencies.
-- 3. Comedy and Sports are the top revenue-generating film categories.
-- 4. Frequent renters were identified and stored in a view for further targeting.
-- 5. Indexing rental dates can optimize query performance for time-based reports.
-- 
-- Overall, the project achieved its goal of using SQL to analyze and extract valuable business data 
-- from a relational database. The approach can easily be scaled to real-world eCommerce or retail systems.
